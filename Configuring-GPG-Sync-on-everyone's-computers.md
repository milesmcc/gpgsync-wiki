Each list of fingerprints that you'd like GPG Sync to keep refreshed is called an keylist, and you can have as many as you'd like (for example, if you belong to multiple organizations). To get started, all you need to do is add a keylist and specify the `Authority Key Fingerprint` and the `Fingerprints URL`, and click the save button. GPG Sync will verify that the fingerprints file has been set up correctly, and if so, immediately sync the keylist.

That's it. Just leave GPG Sync open in the background, and it will make sure all of your GPG keys get synced at least once a day.
